<h2>Temperature Detection Circuit.</h2>
<P>****************************************************************</P>
<p>The project entails constructing and testing a temperature detection circuit using a Thermistor and operational amplifiers. In the practical phase, the circuit is built and measured for different Rs values. In the simulation phase, the circuit is modified for diode replacements, and simulations are conducted for various Rs values. The report includes an explanation of the circuit, simulation results, a comparison with hand calculations, and a conclusion. The project is titled "Temperature Detection Circuit: Design, Implementation, and Simulation."</p>
